These eight consonants are referred to here as \"marked\" consonants. Stacking If you are familiar with the Tibetan script, you will know of \"stacking,\" the convention of placing letters on top of one another to form consonant clusters. Stacking is used here as well, but with a different function. Because this orthography has no inherent vowel, consonant clusters can be written simply by placing characters side by side. When one consonant is stacked beneath another, however, it signals the presence of an implicit schwa [\u0259] between them. In this way, the writing system allows clusters that might otherwise be unpronounceable to appear in orthography. This example illustrates the difference: - \u0f66\u0f51\u0f72 = [ska] - \u0f66\u0fa1\u0f72 = [s\u0259ka] Marked consonants (those written with subjoined \u0f62) are not permitted in stacks due to their orthographic formation. When marked consonants occur in normal consonant clusters, an implicit schwa is automatically inserted to make the cluster pronounceable. The only exception is the voiced alveolar trill /r/, which occurs in certain consonant clusters without an implicit schwa. Additionally, the consonant \u0f62 (h) cannot appear in subjoined position. Transliteration When a word (say, a proper name) is transliterated into the language, the word is marked in the orthography with a \u0f68\u0f7b mark on the first character.

When marked consonants occur in normal consonant clusters, an implicit schwa is automatically inserted to make the cluster pronounceable. The only exception is the voiced alveolar trill /r/, which occurs in certain consonant clusters without an implicit schwa. Additionally, the consonant \u0f62 (h) cannot appear in subjoined position.","title":"Stacking"},{"location":"Orthography/#transliteration","text":"When a word (say, a proper name) is transliterated into the language, the word is marked in the orthography with a \u0f68\u0f7b mark on the first character.","title":"Transliteration"},{"location":"Orthography/#examples","text":"\u0f49\u0fb2\u0f66\u0f7a \u2192 [q\u02bc\u0259si] \u0f50\u0fb6\u0f72\u0f74\u0f61\u0f91 \u2192 [\u0255\u0259s\u0129m\u0259\u014b] \u0f56\u0fa8\u0f7c\u0f63 \u2192 [t\u0259zun] \u0f54\u0f55\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f51 \u2192 [drak] \u0f66\u0fa1\u0f72\u0f5d\u0f92\u0f56\u0fb6\u0f7a\u0f55\u0fa1\u0f4f\u0fad\u0f7c\u0f66\u0fb2\u0f41 \u2192 [s\u0259ka\u0281\u0259p.t\u0259si\u027e\u0259k.g\u0259\u0281u\u0282\u0259\u014b] \u0f68\u0f72\u0f7b\u0f63\u0f56\u0fb3\u0f7a \u2192 [ant\u0259ni] (Anthony)","title":"Examples"},{"location":"Phonology/","text":"Phonology Consonants Bilabial Labiodental Alveolar Palatal Retroflex Velar Uvular Glottal Plosive p, b, p\u02bc \u2014 t, d, t\u02bc \u2014 \u0288, \u0256, \u027d\u0361r\u0325 k, g, k\u02bc q, \u0262, q\u02bc \u2014 Affricate \u2014 \u2014 t\u0361s, d\u0361z t\u0255 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Fricative \u2014 f, v s, z \u0255 \u0282, \u0290 \u2014 \u0281 h Nasal m \u2014 n \u2014 \u2014 \u014b \u2014 \u2014 Trill \u2014 \u2014 r, r\u0325 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Tap/Flap \u2014 \u2014 \u027e \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Approximant \u2014 \u2014 \u0279\u0320 j \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Vowels Oral Nasal Front i \u0129 Central a, (\u0259) \u00e3 Back u \u0169 Note: /\u0169/ is phonetically realized closer to [\u00f5].","title":"Phonology"},{"location":"Phonology/#phonology","text":"","title":"Phonology"},{"location":"Phonology/#consonants","text":"Bilabial Labiodental Alveolar Palatal Retroflex Velar Uvular Glottal Plosive p, b, p\u02bc \u2014 t, d, t\u02bc \u2014 \u0288, \u0256, \u027d\u0361r\u0325 k, g, k\u02bc q, \u0262, q\u02bc \u2014 Affricate \u2014 \u2014 t\u0361s, d\u0361z t\u0255 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Fricative \u2014 f, v s, z \u0255 \u0282, \u0290 \u2014 \u0281 h Nasal m \u2014 n \u2014 \u2014 \u014b \u2014 \u2014 Trill \u2014 \u2014 r, r\u0325 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Tap/Flap \u2014 \u2014 \u027e \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Approximant \u2014 \u2014 \u0279\u0320 j \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014","title":"Consonants"},{"location":"Phonology/#vowels","text":"Oral Nasal Front i \u0129 Central a, (\u0259) \u00e3 Back u \u0169 Note: /\u0169/ is phonetically realized closer to [\u00f5].","title":"Vowels"},{"location":"Phonotactics/","text":"Phonotactics Syllable Structure The basic syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C)(C). Consonant clusters may appear both in onset and coda positions, but are subject to many restrictions described below. The vowel /\u0259/ functions differently from the full vowels /a, i, u/. It is best understood as an epenthetic vowel: it surfaces in clusters that would otherwise be extremely difficult or impossible, particularly in stacked (orthographic) consonants. For this reason, the structure can alternatively be analyzed as (C)(\u0259)(C)V(C)(\u0259)(C), where schwa may intervene to \u201crescue\u201d clusters without acting as a full vowel of its own. While all consonants are allowed as onsets, only certain consonants are allowed as singleton codas. In particular, the following list of consonants are disallowed as singleton codas: - The ejectives: [p'], [t'], [k'], [q'] - The retroflex stops and fricatives: [\u0288], [\u0256], [\u0282], [\u0290] - The glottal fricative: [h] - The uvular stops: [q], [\u0262] - The palatal affricate: [t\u0255] Consonant Clusters Orthographically, two mechanisms exist: 1. True clusters , written as adjacent consonants. 2. Schwa-clusters , normally written with stacking, where a schwa is inserted between consonants. Generally, schwa-clusters are far less restrictive than true clusters. True Clusters As noted in the orthography section, marked consonants, excluding /r/, do not appear at all in true clusters. These consist of the ejectives, the retroflex fricatives, and the retroflex trill.

A cluster consisting of two identical consonants. A cluster consisting of two uvular consonants. A cluster consisting of a consonant and its voiced/voiceless pair.
