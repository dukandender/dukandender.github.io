### Possession
Possession is marked in two different ways depending on if it is alienable or inalienable.

**Inalienable**
Inalienable possession is marked by compounding the words with the connector སཉི \[sqa]. 

Example: 
"The man's child": ཡྷོབིུསཉིཔེཔེ (DEF+man+POSS+child)

**Alienable**
Alienable possession is marked by the particle སྙི \[səqa], placed before the object that is being possessed. If the *subject* of the clause is the possessed object, then possession is marked by putting the particle before the verb instead. 

Examples:
I see the man's cat:
ཡྷོབིུ་སྙི་ཀོཁིཡ


Word order hierarchy
direct object -> indirect object -> dummy, obliques are complicated
If there’s nothing of the form higher in the hierarchy, attach to the next thing that does exist. If nothing exists use the dummy.

Word order for subject object:
General word order follows the hierarchy, where “verb” is at the top and you go to the left from there
Subject attaches right before verb *except* when the list particle is involved

OTHER IDEA: Subject word order is free. Before the verb is maybe the "default" if you're not really thinking about it. But subject acts as a light 'topic marker'

List particle: means “the next word is another in the same level, not a step up”

maybe also a particle for each jump in the hierarchy, except the “last direct object to verb” jump which is unmarked.  Then placement in the hierarchy need not be marked (indirect object + verb would just have the “indirect object jump” particle before the verb)

If the subject is a bare pronoun, use the reflexive pronoun objects and double up. Otherwise, use dummy pronoun + the normal object. The first way might be considered something that is falling out of use and it’d be understood if you always did it the second way 

Particles for ”on”, “around”, etc: go between the words they act on, unless there’s a list particle in between:
Examples:
I eat the food on the table: “table on i+food eat
The food is on the table in the house
“Table on house in dummy+food be”
The food is on the table and in the house
“Table on list house in dummy+food be”


Relative particle comes before relative clause, which comes before the host. Clause end is unambiguous as verbs end clauses. Has two forms for if its talking about a subject or an object
Relative object and subject are all you need (2 words only)


### Descriptives

After the main subject-object body of a word come a series of suffixes called "descriptives". Although roots are very often either primarily descriptive roots or primarily noun roots, which one they are in a given word is determined by their placement rather than their sound.

The category of descriptive is known by the descriptive marker that precedes it. The marker does not need to immediately precede it: instead, the marker applies to all following descriptives until the next marker is used. 

There are three descriptive markers:
1. The adjectival descriptive marker རི \[ha]. This marker tell you that the descriptives that follow it modify the *object* to which the marker is attached. 
2. The adverbal descriptive marker རོ \[hu]. This marker tell you that the descriptives that follow it modify the *verb* of the clause of which the attached object is an object. Depending on the descriptor, it also can make it modify the *event* described by the clause in general. It is typically applied only to objects that directly precede the verb, or to the direct object of the verb, though it can in principle be marked on any object.
3. The subject adjectival descriptive marker རིུ \[hĩ]. This marker tells you that the descriptives that follow it modify the *subject* of the clause of which the attached object is an object. It is, almost as a rule, applied only to objects with attached subjects.
