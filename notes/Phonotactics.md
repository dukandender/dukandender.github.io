# Phonotactics

## Syllable Structure

The basic syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C)(C). Consonant clusters may appear both in onset and coda positions, but are subject to many restrictions described below.  

The vowel /ə/ functions differently from the full vowels /a, i, u/. It is best understood as an epenthetic vowel: it surfaces in clusters that would otherwise be extremely difficult or impossible, particularly in stacked (orthographic) consonants. For this reason, the structure can alternatively be analyzed as (C)(ə)(C)V(C)(ə)(C), where schwa may intervene to “rescue” clusters without acting as a full vowel of its own. 

While all consonants are allowed as onsets, only certain consonants are allowed as singleton codas. In particular, the following list of consonants are disallowed as singleton codas:
- The ejectives: \[p'\], \[t'\], \[k'\], \[q'\]
- The retroflex stops and fricatives: \[ʈ\], \[ɖ\], \[ʂ\], \[ʐ\]
- The glottal fricative: \[h\]
- The uvular stops: \[q\], \[ɢ\]
- The palatal affricate: \[tɕ\]
## Consonant Clusters

Orthographically, two mechanisms exist:
1. **True clusters**, written as adjacent consonants.  
2. **Schwa-clusters**, normally written with stacking, where a schwa is inserted between consonants.
Generally, schwa-clusters are far less restrictive than true clusters.
### True Clusters

As noted in the orthography section, marked consonants, excluding /r/, do not appear at all in true clusters. These consist of the ejectives, the retroflex fricatives, and the retroflex trill.
#### Onsets

The following structural types are permitted: 
- Fricative + stop: སབ \[st\], སག \[sp\], ཐཔ \[ɕd\]
	- The labiodental fricatives \[f\] and \[v\] are not allowed in this type of cluster.
	- Uvular stops are generally disallowed in this type of cluster, with the exception of སཉ \[sq\].
	- Clusters with voiced fricatives in the initial position are generally excluded.
	- Retroflex stops are excluded.
- Stop + rhotic: ཏཕྲ \[gr\], ཀཝ \[bʁ\], ཐཕ \[dɾ\]
	- Uvular stops (\[q\],\[ɢ\]) do not occur in this cluster type.
	-  Retroflex stops are excluded.
- Fricative + nasal: མལ \[zn\], སཁ \[sŋ\], ཐཡ \[ɕm\]
	- The labiodental fricatives \[f\] and \[v\] are not allowed in this type of cluster.
- Fricative + rhotic: ཆཟ \[fr̥\], སཝ \[sʁ\], མཕ \[zɾ\]
	- The labiodental fricative \[v\] is not allowed in this type of cluster.
	- The voiceless alveolar trill \[r̥\] is not allowed after a voiced consonant.
#### Codas

Anything that is not permitted as a singleton coda cannot appear at the end of a coda cluster.

The following structural types are permitted: 
- Stop + fricative: དས \[ks\], ཏམ \[gz\], གས \[ps\]
	- \[ɕ\] does not appear in this type of cluster.
- Nasal + stop: ལབ \[nt\], ལཔ \[nd\], ཁཏ \[ŋg\]
	-  Retroflex stops are excluded.
- Rhotic + stop: ཟབ \[rt\], ཝག \[ʁp\], ཕཔ \[ɾd\]
	- The voiceless alveolar rhotic must be followed by a voiceless stop.

### Schwa Clusters

Schwa clusters are extremely loose. The following are the only general restrictions on what might appear in one:
- A schwa-cluster in the coda of a syllable cannot end with a consonant that is disallowed as a singleton coda.
- A cluster consisting of two identical consonants.
- A cluster consisting of two uvular consonants.
- A cluster consisting of a consonant and its voiced/voiceless pair.
- A cluster consisting of two retroflex consonants.
- A cluster consisting of two trills.
- A cluster consisting of two ejectives.
- A cluster ending in \[h\].
