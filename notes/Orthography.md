The (computer-friendly) standard orthography is written using the [Tibetan Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_script), although all sound values have been reassigned without reference to the sounds they make in existing Tibetic languages, so knowing such a language will not help you read it.
#### Vowels
| Script          | Sound |
| --------------- | ----- |
| ཨི              | a     |
| ཨིུ             | ã     |
| ཨེ              | i     |
| ཨེུ             | ĩ     |
| ཨོ              | u     |
| ཨོུ             | ũ     |
| Explained later | ə     |
As in typical use of Tibetan script, vowels are marked with diacritics, making this writing system an abugida. Unlike in typical Indic scripts, lack of a vowel diacritic does not imply any specific vowel, and in fact all vowels are marked by diacritics. Like in Tibetan, the letter ཨ marks a lack of a consonant and is used in words that begin with a vowel.

Note that certain consonants (in particular, the phonemes /p’/, /t’/, /k’/, /q’/, /ʂ/, /ʐ/, /r/, and /ɽ͡r̥/) are written using a base letter with a subjoined ར. These eight consonants are referred to here as "marked" consonants.
## Stacking

If you are familiar with the Tibetan script, you will know of "stacking," the convention of placing letters on top of one another to form consonant clusters. Stacking is used here as well, but with a different function. Because this orthography has no inherent vowel, consonant clusters can be written simply by placing characters side by side. When one consonant is stacked beneath another, however, it signals the presence of an implicit schwa \[ə\] between them. In this way, the writing system allows clusters that might otherwise be unpronounceable to appear in orthography.  

This example illustrates the difference:  
- སདི = \[ska\]  
- སྡི = \[səka\]  

Marked consonants (those written with subjoined ར) are not permitted in stacks due to their orthographic formation. When marked consonants occur in normal consonant clusters, an implicit schwa is automatically inserted to make the cluster pronounceable. The only exception is the voiced alveolar trill /r/, which occurs in certain consonant clusters without an implicit schwa. Additionally, the consonant ར (h) cannot appear in subjoined position.  

### Transliteration

When a word (say, a proper name) is transliterated into the language, the word is marked in the orthography with a ཨཻ mark on the first character.
